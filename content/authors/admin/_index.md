Hi there! My name is Erika Jacobs, and I'm a data enthusiast. Throughout various professional and educational opportunities, I've always enjoyed working with data one way or another. My career interests have recently pivoted toward data engineering, with great interest in programming and providing clean and polished data products to others. 

Feel free to reach out to me through LinkedIn - I'm always looking for new connections in the realm of data. Thank you for stopping by my webpage!
