Hi there! My name is Erika Jacobs, and I'm a data enthusiast pivoting toward a career in data engineering. Throughout various professional opportunities and a master's degree in Applied Statistics, I've always enjoyed working with data one way or another. These experiences have solidified my ultimate interest in the technical aspects of creating data products for others to use, as well as ensuring my work is accessible and easy to understand.

I have technical experience using Python, SQL, R Studio, Tableau, and Spark with an aptitude to learn new software and programs independently. I also have strong skills in communication, education, and communication from my personal involvement in the performing arts and academia.

Feel free to reach out to me through LinkedIn - I'm always looking for new connections in the realm of data. Thank you for stopping by my webpage!
