title: COVID-19 "Sparked" some AWS Ideas
---
Ahhh...the Coronavirus. The pesky virus that stopped daily life as we know it. The pesky virus that everyone's looking to understand a little better. The pesky virus that has many people looking at data visualizations like *never* before. 

Like many other data enthusiasts out there, I thought the Coronavirus seemed like a perfect topic to explore different skills I've been learning related to Data Engineering.

Prior to this project, I had never used any cloud platform for a personal project. I also had never done a project using PySpark as well, even though I already had some experience. As for DataBricks? DataBricks was entirely new territory. This blog will be telling you a little bit about each of these technologies, and what makes them useful for a project like this!

## Takeaways From Project

This project could have been done without PySpark, but I'm glad that I had a real world project to apply my knowledge to.

AWS is free to a certain extent, but be careful...
