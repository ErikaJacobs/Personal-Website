title: 'The Itsy Bitsy "Spyder" Saved My Project'
---

About six months ago, I stumbled across a confidential real life opportunity to exercise my skills in working with data. While I can't talk specifics about the data I was working with or who this project was for, I was very excited to help with this project because the resulting access to this data will be extremely helpful to many people I care about : blush :

I'm so excited to tell you about the progress made on this project so far, as well as what I've learned about Spyder!
