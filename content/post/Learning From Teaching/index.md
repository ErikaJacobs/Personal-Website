title: 'Learning From Teaching: A Reflection'
---
If you're looking at the posts on my website or activity on GitHub, you might notice some very long gaps of activity between August 2019 and now (April 2020). Most of that is due to a personal passion of mine - I started my first year teaching at the college level, and recently finished it!

I taught two courses at Chandler-Gilbert Community College this year. Fall 2019 I taught MAT 142 (College Mathematics), and taught MAT 051 in Spring 2020 (Number Sense). Teaching both courses offered very different experiences, and Ilearned very different things from both courses as a result. Through those experiences, I feel better equipped to move forward into teaching future courses! 

## Teaching Going Forward

Currently, I am not slated to teach at Chandler-Gilbert during the summer or fall semesters of 2020. While I enjoy teaching, teaching on top of a full time job can be *very* difficult - especially when it's a class that you've never taught before. I feel like my teaching days are just beginning, yet I do need a break to focus on other aspects of my life. I will definitely revisit the idea of teaching in Spring 2021 and go from there :smile:

One of the things I'm looking to focus on during this break is my website and data-related projects. Expect to see more content coming soon! One thing I'd love to do eventually is start a "Data for Dummies" Youtube series and show people how to do a variety of data-related tasks. I feel like there's a huge market for teachers in the realm of data analytics, especially with more complex processes. Through learning on my own, I've found that most data science-related tutorials and guides assume a ton of technical knowledge that newcomers might not have. I'd love to help bridge that gap eventually!

I also wanted to spend more time with friends and family, but it doesn't seem like that will be happening given the current COVID-19 state of things. Luckily, social distancing gives plenty of time for new content :wink:

# A Reflection on Year One

Ultimately, I am SO grateful to have had the opportunity to teach at Chandler-Gilbert Community College this past year. I have learned SO much, and hope my students have learned plenty as well! I wanted to take a moment to reflect about this year, as well as the things I've learned through this experience.

Before getting into my reflections, there was one cool experience I had this year that doesn't really fit anywhere else - So I'm putting it here :smile:

I volunteered to help with CGCC's Excellence in Mathematics competition at the beginning of February, in which different middle schools came together to compete in mathematics both individually and as a group. Fun fact: I actually ATTENDED this competition when I was in 8th grade!

![](eim.png)

As an 8th grader, I went to this competition because my friends were all going, and I wanted to go with them. I liked math enough - If my friends are going, why not join them? 

WELL. Here we are years later, and I'm working that SAME math competition. The teacher that brought us years ago? She's there with her students too! It was a really cool moment to be able to reunite for both of us, and will be an experience I'll never forget.

This moment made me see how far I've come, and how much I've grown since that first competition, nevertheless through the last year of teaching. I'm very excited to share my reflections. Feel free to read as much (or as little) of my reflections below as you'd like!

## Teaching Online and Teaching In Person

Teaching online requires MORE work, and it becomes harder to teach life skills. 

## Being an Adjunct
The internet is full of adjuncts who want better pay and full time employement. 

## Not Reinventing the Wheel

It can be really exhausting to churn out new content twice a week. If there's a starting point that other professors can provide, go for it.

## Taking Baby Steps

Venn Diagram lesson was a BUST.

## Being Patient

You would be surprised how many things need to be explicitly explained in the classroom. Not just related to content, but to life skills as well.

Suppose you don't know what a word means. What do you do? You might Google it, you might ask a friend, or you might have a physical dictionary to look it up.

Something as simple as knowing how to add a subject onto a message needs to be explained sometimes.

Teaching students to ask questions

## Students and Structure

Students LOVE structure. They love calendars, they love due dates, and they love knowing how long it will take for their tests to be graded.

## Accountability Goes Both Ways

Student concerns

Lying about deaths

"You don't believe in me"

Due dates teach life skills

Being flexible, but not *too* flexible to where you can be taken advantage of.

Careful with FERPA

Remedial math is very different

If you say you're going to do something, do it.

Being flexible, but not *too* flexible to where you can be taken advantage of.

## Letting Go

As important as it is to give structure to students in a classroom setting, it's also a good practice to give students choices whenever possible. While you can teach a student to make good choices, "good choices" shouldn't be forced onto them - By forcing "good choices" onto students, they end up making "good choices" for their grades, but not because it's the choice they truly want to make.

Sometimes students need to make bad choices to learn how to make good choices. Sometimes, a good choice to me isn't the best choice for a student. I've learned that sometimes it's best to let go of certain structures and let a student take charge of their educational destiny.

Computer labs - it was less beneficial to keep all students there, and more beneficial to dismiss class and focus on the students who were hungry for 1-on-1 attention. Developed better relationships with students that way.

Attendance activities - wish I never did them. Forced disengaged students to come to class, which distracted the people that DID want to learn.

## Classroom Management: Community College Edition

Disrespectful behavior has to be handled immediately, or other students will follow suit.

Don't want to embarrass or bring attention to disrespect. Don't want to make them feel babied.

Being confrontational is not something that comes naturally to me, yet is something I've been actively working on. 

## Rate My Professor

Bad ratings are humbling, but don't mean you're a terrible teacher. 

An experiential learning style can be tough. Students feel like they have no idea what they're doing, and that's a very uncomfortable feeling. However, what they don't realize is they're learning more that way than if I were to do repeated examples on the board for them.

Now, that's not to say that every lesson I made was perfect. I can think of many that completely failed.

LOVE feedback - 

## Life Balance = Important
My most thought-out planned lessons went the worst, and had students feeling the most confused. The lessons I spent the least time on? Went AMAZINGLY.

You're a better teacher when you're taking care of yourself on the way.

## Have Fun!
Even if your subject matter is dry, having a little bit of fun with it goes a long way with students. 

Brianna's budget - students had SO much fun talking about how stupid Brianna's financial decisions were and correcting them using real life examples.

Exponential growth assignment Pandemic - very creative
